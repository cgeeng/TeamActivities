# A Guide to Quality Team Activities


The following guide is a list of ways you can make sure your team activities are effective and beneficial towards your learning. This list was compiled by feedback from students for students! 


* Read the activity BEFORE the team meeting.
* Use a google doc or word doc that is collaborative and shared to anyone with the link (or if word, the meeting itself) to update for your notes.
* If you are pair programming and using on screen, make sure everyone can see what you are coding.
  * This allows for better collaboration and understanding of the code.
  * It also allows for the team to work on the same code at the same time.
  * Make sure it is a collaborative effort and not just one person coding. 
* Try to contribute even if you feel you aren't fully caught up. Chances are other team members will help you understand the concept better. 
* Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions and take a bit longer on discussion if needed


The team activity is a guided study session, and it is only as effective as the team. **The more you put into it, the more you will get out of it.** Your overall goal isn't to finish every task and just go. Your goal is to learn and understand the material, and make sure all your team members better understand the material. This may mean more discussion, more questions, and more time. Other times, you may find the sessions rather quick. 


The TAs will be walking around to answer questions as well.
  
## Grading
Grades for team activities will be based on attendance and notes. You must attend, and as a team you need to generate notes that we can confirm your work. Upload the notes as a PDF to the Canvas assignment after.. 

> [!TIP] Good notes become a study guide for you and your team! Make sure they include everything you need to help better understand the weekly material. 

### Going beyond the weekly material
In addition to the weekly material, team activities will present new ideas and concepts that relate to the material. These ideas are more the practical application of the material, or how it may appear in industry discussion. They are meant to give you deeper insight and understanding of the material.
